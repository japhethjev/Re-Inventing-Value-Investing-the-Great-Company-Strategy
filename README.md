I intended to revolutionize value investing by developing a value investing strategy and then used pythong programming to implement the strategy. This strategy is called The Great Company Strategy.
It uses 6 equations as the selection criteria for identifying and scoring stocks. The system will pull data of the US stocks and subject them to the 6 criteria test based on the companies financial fundamentals.
These financial fundamentals of companies built into the evaluation engine are the gross profit margin, EBITDA margin, PE ratio, EV/EBITDA, Debt/Equity ratio and Return on Equity.
The scoring engine would after analysing thousands of US Stock, produce  outputs that comprise the table showing the companies analysed and their corresponding greatness score, chart that plot the greatness score aginst each company, and a csv file to download the list of companies and their score.
Companies that are assigned a higher greatness score of 80 and above have greater upside potential to grow their in share price in next 6 months than companies with lower greatness score.
The investing decision is to BUY stocks that have highest greatness score and sell those with low score.
